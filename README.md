# Introduction to Deep Learning
This repo contains some of the exercices that I worked on during the lecture Introduction to Deep Learning in the winter semester 2020/2021.

I chose only the most relevant ones, where we built our own networks in ```Python```,  ```Pytorch``` and ```Pytorch Lightning```.

# Project Details
Each exercice folder contains _jupyter notebooks_ with extensive explainations of the tasks to be solved and the solution that I implemented. 

This project requires to have ```Pytorch```, ```Pytorch Lightning``` and ```Tensorboard``` installed, as well as, other packages that are listed in the ```requirements.txt``` file.

Please run: 
```bash 
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
on your terminal after cloning this repo.


Additionally, I thought it would be useful to add **Exercice 7**, which is merely a tutorial of how to install ```Pytorch```, ```Pytorch Lightning``` and ```Tensorboard```. 

This repo should merely provide some insights on some of my early experience with deep learning.
